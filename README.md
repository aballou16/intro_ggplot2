# intro_ggplot2
## Introduction to ggplot2 with example code and applications

In the included R markdown document (intro_ggplot_final.Rmd), I've included an introduction to ggplot, example code, and walkthrough exercises. 

Topics include:

- Introduction to ggplot
- Installation and Set-Up (and working example data)
- ggplot basics
- Scales
- Titles, subtitles, & labels: Basics
- Titles, subtitles & labels: Extensions
- Legends
- Reference Lines
- Facets
- Themes
- Combining Plots
- Exporting Plots

The example exercises leverage the `Storms` data from `dplyr`. 

Part of the introductory material draws from Dr. Ben Baumer's introductory to Statistics and Data Science course. Dr. Baumer's github can be found [here](https://github.com/beanumber).
